# CMake template project for AppGameKit 2
Made to make possible Tier 2 development using non-Microsoft IDEs, such as CLion, vim, etc.

The template currently requires a Visual Studio toolchain to be set up. Windows only for now, but the plans are to take advantage of CMake to have a multiplatform template available.

Tested on CLion.
